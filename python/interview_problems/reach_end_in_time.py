# Reach the end in time

# A 2-D grid consisting of some blocked (represented as '#') and some unblocked (represented as '.') cells is given.
# The starting position of a pointer is in the top-left corner of the grid. It is guaranteed that the starting position is in an unblocked cell. 
# It is also guaranteed that the bottom-right cell is unblocked. Each cell of the grid is connected with its  right, left, top and bottom cell (if those cell exits).
# It takes 1 second for a pointer to move from a cell to its adjacent cell. If the pointer can reach the bottom-right corner of the grid within k seconds, return the string 'Yes'
# Otherwise, return the string 'No'.

# Example
# rows = 3
# grid = ['..##', '#.##', '#...']
# maxTime = 5
